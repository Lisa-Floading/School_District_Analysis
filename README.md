# School District Analysis 
## Overview 
Prepared under the direction of the Chief Data Scientist for the City School System, an analysis of standarized test data was undertaken for reporting and presentation to all stakeholders for the district. Using Pandas, the information was put into DataFrames for analysis. The goal is to aggregate the data to show trends in school performance in reading and math as well as district spending. The insights provided by this analysis may inform budgetary decisions at the school and district level. 

The scores for Thomas High School have been compromised and have therefore been removed from the full analysis. The purpose of the following report is to compare the original school district analysis to the second analysis with Thomas High School scores removed.  Note that the privacy of individual student records is protected under FERPA
